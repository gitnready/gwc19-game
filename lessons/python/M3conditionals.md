# M3: Core 4: Conditionals

## What is a conditional?
**The computer can make decisions for you**
Conditionals use data and true/false commands to make decisions for you. They are most often structured as if statements or if/else statements.

## Try out some basic conditional statements in Python
1. Left-click the Windows button at the bottom left of the screen.
1. Using the keyboard, type `idle` and then left-click the icon.
1. Inside your Python 3.\* shell, type the following two lines, hitting the enter key after each command:
    ```
    num1 = 5
    num2 = 6
    if (num1 > num2):
      print(str(num1)+" is greater than "+str(num2))
    else:
      print(str(num2)+" is less than "+str(num1))
    ```
    *Note:* Why don't you need to put a condition on the else statement?
